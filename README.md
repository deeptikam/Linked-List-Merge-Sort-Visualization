**Linked List Merge Sort Visualization**

A simple C project to visualize merge sort on linked lists using ASCII bars. It generates a random list of numbers, prints them as vertical bars, and visually shows how the list is recursively split and merged. I made this to demonstrate knowledge of memory, pointers, algorithms, and data structures from the classes that I have taken at CMU (such as 15-122).

In order to run this project, follow these steps in your terminal:
1. Go into project folder
2. make
3. ./sort
